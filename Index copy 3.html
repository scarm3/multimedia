<h1>I go to the University of New Haven</h1>

</body><p>I am sitting in a class right now. I really dont understand dreamweaver but I am trying my best. This class hasn't been hard yet but its difficult to code. I do not have much experience with this, however, I wish I did. I hope to gain a little bit of an understanding of coding soon. </p>

<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>My hobbies include going to concerts, working on productions, and much more. I haven't been to any concerts recently because of school but I have a few coming in the future. They are a fun way to pass time with friends. I have been to over 40 concerts in my life which is a bit extreme, however, it has been worth it every time. The most recent concert I went to was Niall Horan at the Xfinity Theater in Hartford.  </p>
