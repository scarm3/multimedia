<h1> Production Work</h1>
<p> At the University of New Haven I have served as the Social Media Head for the show "Pitch Perfect with Mike Maguire" and the Assistant Producer of the show "On The Spot."</p>
<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>My hobbies include going to concerts, working on productions, and much more. I haven't been to any concerts recently because of school but I have a few coming in the future. They are a fun way to pass time with friends. I have been to over 40 concerts in my life which is a bit extreme, however, it has been worth it every time. The most recent concert I went to was Niall Horan at the Xfinity Theater in Hartford.  </p>
